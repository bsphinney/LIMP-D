# DE-LIMP: Differential Expression & Limpa Proteomics

**DE-LIMP** is a modern, interactive R Shiny application for differential expression analysis of DIA-NN proteomics data. Built on **Limpa** and **Limma** for robust statistics, with **Google Gemini AI** integration for intelligent data exploration.

> **Why "DE-LIMP"?**
> Because analyzing differential expression shouldn't make you walk with a limp. 🧬🚶‍♂️

## ✨ What's New in v2.1

**Major UI/UX Enhancements** (February 2026):
- 🎯 **Four-Way Comparison Selector Sync** - Signal Distribution, Expression Grid, P-value Distribution, and DE Dashboard selectors now sync automatically
- 📊 **Enhanced Dataset Summary** - DE protein counts per comparison with explicit directional arrows (↑ higher in X, ↓ higher in Y)
- 🔬 **P-value Distribution Diagnostic** - Automated pattern detection with color-coded guidance (healthy, inflation, low power, model issues)
- 📈 **CV Distribution Histogram** - Visual distribution of protein variability per experimental group
- 🤖 **AI Summary Relocated** - Moved from modal popup to dedicated Data Overview sub-tab with inline display
- 🌋 **Volcano Plot Annotations** - FDR and logFC thresholds clearly labeled with significance criteria legend box
- 🎨 **Signal Distribution Enhancement** - Always shows DE coloring automatically with dedicated comparison selector
- 🎨 **Responsive Plot Heights** - All plots use viewport-relative units for optimal viewing on any screen size

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for full release history.

## 🚀 Deployment & Access

**DE-LIMP is available in three ways:**

### 🌐 Web Access (No Installation Required)
**Try it now:** [huggingface.co/spaces/brettsp/de-limp-proteomics](https://huggingface.co/spaces/brettsp/de-limp-proteomics)
- Run directly in your browser
- No R installation needed
- Perfect for quick analyses and exploring features
- Note: Limited computational resources compared to local installation

### 💻 Local Installation (Recommended for Regular Use)
- Full computational power of your machine
- Better for large datasets and multiple analyses
- See Installation section below for setup instructions
- Download from: [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/bsphinney/DE-LIMP/releases)

### 🖥️ HPC Deployment (High-Performance Computing)
- Deploy on cluster environments (SLURM, PBS, etc.)
- Use Apptainer/Singularity containers
- Three deployment options including direct pull from Hugging Face
- Full guide: [HPC_DEPLOYMENT.md](HPC_DEPLOYMENT.md)

> **Note for Developers:** This repository is deployed to both GitHub (source code + releases) and Hugging Face Spaces (web deployment). The repositories track the same codebase but have different README.md files due to platform requirements.
