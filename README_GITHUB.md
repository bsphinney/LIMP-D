# DE-LIMP: Differential Expression & Limpa Proteomics

**DE-LIMP** is a modern, interactive R Shiny application for differential expression analysis of DIA-NN proteomics data. Built on **Limpa** and **Limma** for robust statistics, with **Google Gemini AI** integration for intelligent data exploration.

> **Why "DE-LIMP"?**
> Because analyzing differential expression shouldn't make you walk with a limp. 🧬🚶‍♂️

## ✨ What's New in v2.2

**Contextual Help System** (February 2026):
- ❓ **15 info modal buttons** across every major tab — click `?` for in-context guidance on any plot or table
- Covers: QC Plots, DE Dashboard, Data Overview, Consistent DE, QC Trends, GSEA, Methodology, Data Chat
- Each modal explains what you're seeing, what "good" and "bad" look like, and what to do next

**Improved DE Dashboard**:
- 🌋 **Volcano → Table filtering** - Selecting proteins in the volcano plot now filters the results table
- 🗺️ **MDS Plot legend** - Color-coded group legend now visible inside the plot
- 📊 **Heatmap expanded by default** - No more clicking to open the accordion

**Cleaner Layouts**:
- Normalization Diagnostic and P-value Distribution help content moved to modals (no more layout interference)
- P-value guidance banner moved below the plot so the comparison dropdown isn't crowded

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for full release history.

### Previous: v2.1 Highlights
- 📈 **XIC Chromatogram Viewer** with MS2 Intensity Alignment and ion mobility support (Local/HPC)
- 🎯 **Four-Way Comparison Selector Sync** across all tabs
- 🔬 **P-value Distribution Diagnostic** with automated pattern detection
- 🌋 **Volcano Plot Annotations** with FDR/logFC threshold legend

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for full release history.

### 📈 XIC Chromatogram Viewer (Local/HPC)
- **Fragment-level validation** - Inspect chromatograms for any DE protein
- **MS2 Intensity Alignment** - Spectronaut-style stacked bar chart for fragment ion ratio consistency with automatic inconsistency detection
- **Split-axis MS1/MS2** - Independent y-axes prevent MS1 from squishing fragment peaks

- **Auto-Guess Groups** - Smart detection of experimental groups from filenames
- **Grid View** - Heatmap-style table with UniProt linking and click-to-plot
- **GSEA Integration** - Gene Ontology enrichment analysis
- **Consistent DE** - Identify highly reproducible significant proteins

### 🎓 Education Tab
- Embedded proteomics resources and training materials
- Latest UC Davis Proteomics YouTube videos
- Links to short courses and methodology citations
- Google NotebookLM for exploring key papers

## 🚀 Deployment & Access

**DE-LIMP is available in three ways:**

### 🌐 Web Access (No Installation Required)
**Try it now:** [huggingface.co/spaces/brettsp/de-limp-proteomics](https://huggingface.co/spaces/brettsp/de-limp-proteomics)
- Run directly in your browser
- No R installation needed
- Perfect for quick analyses and exploring features
- Note: Limited computational resources compared to local installation

### 💻 Local Installation (Recommended for Regular Use)
- Full computational power of your machine
- Better for large datasets and multiple analyses
- See Installation section below for setup instructions
- Download from: [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/bsphinney/DE-LIMP/releases)

### 🖥️ HPC Deployment (High-Performance Computing)
- Deploy on cluster environments (SLURM, PBS, etc.)
- Use Apptainer/Singularity containers
- Three deployment options including direct pull from Hugging Face
- Full guide: [HPC_DEPLOYMENT.md](HPC_DEPLOYMENT.md)

> **Note for Developers:** This repository is deployed to both GitHub (source code + releases) and Hugging Face Spaces (web deployment). The repositories track the same codebase but have different README.md files due to platform requirements.
