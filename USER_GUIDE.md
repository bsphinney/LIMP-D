### 📈 XIC Chromatogram Viewer (Local/HPC Only)

The XIC Viewer lets you inspect fragment-level chromatograms for differentially expressed proteins, providing visual validation of quantification quality.

> **Note:** XIC files are generated by DIA-NN alongside the main report and are typically too large for cloud deployment. This feature is available for local and HPC installations only.

> **Hugging Face Users:** The XIC Viewer is not available on the hosted web version. The sidebar section is replaced with a link to download DE-LIMP for local use. To access chromatogram inspection, [download DE-LIMP.R from GitHub](https://github.com/bsphinney/DE-LIMP) and run locally or on your HPC cluster.

#### Setup
1. **Automatic Detection:** When you upload a DIA-NN report, the app automatically checks for a `_xic` directory in the working directory (e.g., `report_xic/` alongside `report.parquet`). If found, the XIC directory path is pre-filled.
2. **Manual Path:** If auto-detection doesn't find your files, paste the path to your XIC directory in the sidebar under **"5. XIC Viewer"** and click **"Load XICs"**.
   - You can also paste the path to the report `.parquet` file — the app will derive the `_xic` directory automatically.
3. The status badge shows the number of XIC files loaded, the detected DIA-NN version (1.x or 2.x), and whether ion mobility data is available.

#### Viewing Chromatograms
1. **Select a protein** in the DE Dashboard (volcano plot click or table row selection).
2. Click the **"📈 XICs"** button in the DE Dashboard results table header (or in the Grid View modal).
3. The XIC modal opens with interactive Plotly chromatograms.

#### Display Controls
- **Display Mode:**
  - *Facet by sample* — Each panel shows one sample with all fragment ions overlaid (color = fragment)
  - *Facet by fragment* — Each panel shows one fragment ion with all samples overlaid (color = group)
  - *Intensity alignment* — Spectronaut-style stacked bar chart showing relative fragment ion proportions per sample. Bars are ordered by experimental group with dashed separators. Automatic inconsistency detection flags samples where fragment ratios deviate significantly (> mean + 2 SD), with green (all consistent) or amber (flagged samples) guidance banners. Tooltips include AUC, proportion, deviation score, and cosine similarity.
- **Show MS1 (split axis):** When checked, the plot splits into two rows:
  - Top row: **MS1 precursor** signal (often much more intense)
  - Bottom row: **MS2 fragment** ions
  - Each row has its own y-axis, preventing the MS1 signal from squishing fragment peaks
- **Precursor Selector:** Choose a specific precursor or view all (top 6 shown for large proteins)
- **Group Filter:** Focus on a specific experimental group
- **Ion Mobility:** When timsTOF/PASEF mobilogram data is detected, a toggle appears with a prominent blue banner indicating ion mobility mode

#### Navigation
- Use **Prev/Next** buttons to step through significant DE proteins
- **Download** button exports the current view as PNG (14×10 inches, 150 DPI)

#### Info Panel
Below the plot, the info panel shows:
- Number of precursors and fragments
- Retention time range
- DE statistics (log2 fold-change and adjusted p-value) for the current comparison

### 🧬 Gene Set Enrichment (GSEA)
1.  Select a **database** from the ontology selector dropdown: Biological Process (BP), Molecular Function (MF), Cellular Component (CC), or KEGG pathways.
2.  Click **"Run GSEA"** for the current contrast.
3.  **Automatic organism detection**: The app queries the UniProt API using your protein IDs to determine the correct organism database. For human data this is instant; for non-human data (mouse, rat, etc.) the API lookup runs automatically.
4.  **Per-ontology caching**: Results are cached separately for each database and contrast combination. Switch between BP, MF, CC, and KEGG without re-running the analysis.
5.  **Contrast indicator**: A banner shows which contrast is active. If you change the comparison, a stale-results warning appears prompting you to re-run.
6.  View results as Dot Plots, Enrichment Maps (networks), Ridgeplots, or browse the full Results Table.

### 🔬 Phosphoproteomics

The phosphoproteomics module provides site-level analysis of phosphorylation data, available when phospho-enriched data is detected.

#### Auto-Detection
- On file upload, the app scans for phospho modifications (`UniMod:21`) and displays a detection banner if phospho data is present
- The **Phosphoproteomics** tab appears automatically when phospho data is detected

#### Input Paths
- **Site matrix upload** (recommended): Upload a DIA-NN 1.9+ `site_matrix_*.parquet` file directly
- **Parsed from report**: The app extracts phosphosites from `Modified.Sequence` columns in your main report file

#### Phase 1 — Site-Level DE
- **Phospho Volcano Plot**: Interactive volcano plot for phosphosite-level differential expression
- **Site Table**: Full results table with site ID, protein, gene, residue, position, fold-change, and significance
- **Residue Distribution**: Breakdown of Serine/Threonine/Tyrosine phosphorylation frequencies
- **QC Completeness**: Missingness analysis across sites and samples with filtering thresholds

#### Phase 2 — Kinase Activity & Motifs
- **KSEA (Kinase-Substrate Enrichment Analysis)**: Infers upstream kinase activity from phosphosite fold-changes using PhosphoSitePlus and NetworKIN databases
- **Sequence Logo Analysis**: Visualizes enriched amino acid motifs around significant phosphosites (up-regulated vs. down-regulated)

#### Phase 3 — Advanced
- **Protein-level abundance correction**: Subtracts protein-level logFC from phosphosite logFC to isolate changes in phosphorylation stoichiometry (requires matched total proteome and phospho-enriched samples)
- **AI context**: Phosphosite DE results and kinase activities are included in the Gemini chat context when phospho analysis is active

## 7. Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
| :--- | :--- |
| **App crashes on startup** | Ensure R 4.5+ is installed. The `limpa` package requires R 4.5 or newer. Download from: https://cloud.r-project.org/ |
| **"limpa package not found"** | Upgrade to R 4.5+, then run: `BiocManager::install('limpa')`. The app will auto-install missing packages on first run. |
| **"Please select a CRAN mirror"** | This should not happen in the current version. If it does, add `options(repos = c(CRAN = "https://cloud.r-project.org"))` at the top of the script. |
| **GSEA fails** | Ensure you are connected to the internet (it needs to download gene ontologies). |
| **GSEA fails with organism error** | The app now auto-detects organism via UniProt API. Ensure internet connection. If detection fails, check that your protein IDs are valid UniProt accessions (e.g., P12345). |
| **Grid View "Object not found"** | Ensure you have run the pipeline first (click "Assign Groups & Run Pipeline"). The Grid View requires processed data. |
| **AI says "No data"** | Click the "▶ Run Pipeline" button first. The AI needs the statistical results to answer questions. Also verify your Gemini API key is entered correctly. |
| **Example data won't download** | Check your internet connection. The file is 46MB and downloads from GitHub Releases. |
| **Can't select multiple proteins in table** | Use Ctrl+Click (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Click (Mac) for individual selections. Use Shift+Click for range selections. |
| **Session file won't load** | Ensure the `.rds` file was created by DE-LIMP v2.0+. Older versions may not be compatible. |
| **Covariate columns not showing** | Click "Assign Groups & Run Pipeline" to open the modal. Covariate columns (Batch, Covariate1, Covariate2) are in the table. |
