# DE-LIMP: Differential Expression & Limpa Proteomics

**DE-LIMP** is a modern, interactive R Shiny application for differential expression analysis of DIA-NN proteomics data. Built on **Limpa** and **Limma** for robust statistics, with **Google Gemini AI** integration for intelligent data exploration.

> **Why "DE-LIMP"?**
> Because analyzing differential expression shouldn't make you walk with a limp. 🧬🚶‍♂️
