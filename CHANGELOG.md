## [2.5.0] - 2026-02-18

### Added

  - **Ontology selector**: Dropdown to switch between BP/MF/CC/KEGG on the GSEA tab
  - **Per-ontology caching**: Results cached per database; switching back loads instantly without re-computation
  - **Contrast indicator**: Shows active contrast with stale-results warning when contrast changes
  - **UniProt API organism detection**: Queries `rest.uniprot.org` to determine organism from accession when no suffix is present — works automatically for human, mouse, rat, and 9 other species
  - **Robust ID mapping**: Handles multiple protein ID formats (pipe-separated, isoform suffixes, organism suffixes); fallback from UNIPROT to SYMBOL ID types
  - **KEGG organism mapping**: Supports 11 species with automatic organism code detection
  - **Dynamic plot titles**: All GSEA plots show which database was used
  - Updated info modals with all 4 database descriptions
  - Session save/load for GSEA cache, last contrast, and organism DB

- **AI Summary — All Comparisons Analysis**:
  - AI Summary now analyzes **all contrasts** simultaneously, not just the selected one
  - Cross-comparison biomarker detection: identifies proteins significant in ≥2 comparisons
  - Enhanced prompt with 5 structured sections: Overview, Key Findings Per Comparison, Cross-Comparison Biomarkers, High-Confidence Biomarker Insights, Biological Interpretation
  - Adaptive token budget: top 30/20/10 proteins per contrast (scales with number of contrasts)
  - `?` info modal explaining what data is/isn't sent to Gemini API

- **MDS Plot Coloring**:
  - Color MDS plot by Group, Batch, Covariate1, or Covariate2
  - Colorblind-friendly Okabe-Ito palette

  - **KSEA kinase-substrate enrichment analysis**: Infers upstream kinase activity from phosphosite fold-changes using `KSEAapp` CRAN package with PhosphoSitePlus + NetworKIN database
  - **KSEA bar plot**: Horizontal bar chart of kinase z-scores (top 15 activated + top 15 inhibited), colored by direction, with substrate count annotations
  - **KSEA results table**: Filterable, sortable DT datatable with kinase gene, z-score, FDR, substrate count. Downloadable as CSV.
  - **Sequence logo motif analysis**: Displays amino acid enrichment around regulated phosphosites using `ggseqlogo`. Separate logos for up-regulated and down-regulated sites.
  - **FASTA upload**: Sidebar file input for protein FASTA. Parses UniProt-format headers to extract accessions. Enables accurate flanking sequence extraction for motif analysis.
  - New "Kinase Activity" and "Motif Analysis" tabs in phospho results navset
  - New packages: `KSEAapp` (CRAN), `ggseqlogo` (CRAN)

- **Phosphoproteomics Phase 3 — Advanced Features**:
