# Changelog

All notable changes to DE-LIMP will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.1.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- **Four-Way Comparison Selector Synchronization**: Signal Distribution, Expression Grid, P-value Distribution, and DE Dashboard selectors now sync automatically when any one changes
- **P-value Distribution Diagnostic Plot**: New QC Plots sub-tab with automated pattern detection
  - Color-coded guidance banners (healthy, inflation, low power, model issues)
  - Expandable interpretation guide
  - Actionable recommendations for troubleshooting
- **CV Distribution Histogram**: New Consistent DE sub-tab showing protein variability distribution per experimental group
- **Dataset Summary DE Counts**: Shows differential expression protein counts for all comparisons with explicit directional language ("X proteins higher in GroupA")
- **AI Summary Sub-Tab**: Dedicated tab in Data Overview (moved from DE Dashboard button)
  - Inline display instead of modal popup
  - Cleaner workflow for AI-generated summaries
- **Volcano Plot Annotations**:
  - Colored threshold lines (blue FDR, orange logFC)
  - Significance criteria legend box in upper-left corner
  - Uses plotly native annotations for reliable rendering
- **Comparison Selectors**: Purple gradient banners on Signal Distribution, Expression Grid, and P-value Distribution tabs

### Changed
- **Signal Distribution Plot**: Now always shows DE coloring when results are available (removed manual toggle buttons)
- **Signal Distribution Plot**: Uses dedicated `contrast_selector_signal` instead of main selector
- **Responsive Plot Heights**: All plots now use viewport-relative units (`vh`, `calc()`) for optimal viewing on any screen size
- **Assign Groups Interface**: Converted from modal popup to permanent sub-tab in Data Overview
- **DE Dashboard**: Removed AI Summary button (moved to Data Overview tab)

### Fixed
- **Volcano Plot Legend**: Fixed text rendering issues by switching from ggplot annotations to plotly native system
- **Reactive Loops**: Signal Distribution table no longer filters based on selection-derived reactives

### Technical
- All comparison selectors (`contrast_selector`, `contrast_selector_signal`, `contrast_selector_grid`, `contrast_selector_pvalue`) sync bidirectionally
- Plotly annotations use paper coordinates (`xref = "paper", yref = "paper"`) for absolute positioning
- No new R package dependencies (all features use existing packages)

## [2.0.0] - 2025-XX-XX

### Initial Release
- Interactive differential expression analysis for DIA-NN proteomics data
- Limpa pipeline integration (DPC normalization, maxLFQ quantification, limma statistics)
- Google Gemini AI chat integration
- Session save/load functionality
- GSEA integration (GO Biological Process)
- Reproducibility code logging
- Example data with Affinisep vs Evosep comparison
- Education tab with embedded resources
