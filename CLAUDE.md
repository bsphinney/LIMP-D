## Project Overview
DE-LIMP is a Shiny proteomics data analysis pipeline using the LIMPA R package for differential expression analysis of DIA-NN data.

**GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/bsphinney/DE-LIMP

## System Requirements
**CRITICAL**: limpa package requires specific R/Bioconductor versions:
- **R version**: 4.5 or newer (required)
- **Bioconductor**: 3.22+ (automatically set with R 4.5+)
- **Installation**: Download R from https://cloud.r-project.org/

**Note**: The app will automatically detect if R version is too old and provide upgrade instructions.

## Recent Changes & Important Fixes

### 2026-02-11: Set Up GitHub Pages Site
1. **Created GitHub Pages landing page** (`docs/index.html`)
   - Professional single-page site for the DE-LIMP project
   - Located in `/docs` directory (configure GitHub Pages to serve from `main` branch `/docs` folder)
   - Includes: project overview, feature highlights, installation instructions, workflow description
   - Contains a curated **proteomics resources** section with links to tools, databases, and learning materials
   - Responsive design with clean CSS (no external dependencies)
   - **To enable**: Go to GitHub repo Settings → Pages → Source: "Deploy from a branch" → Branch: `main`, folder: `/docs`
   - **GitHub Pages URL**: `https://bsphinney.github.io/DE-LIMP/` (once enabled)

### 2026-02-11: Added Save/Load Session Feature
1. **Save/Load Analysis Sessions as RDS** (sidebar UI + server handlers)
   - Feature: Save and Load buttons in sidebar under new "3. Session" section
   - **Save**: Downloads an .rds file containing all analysis state (data, results, settings)
   - **Load**: Opens modal with file picker and confirmation warning
   - Saved state includes: raw_data, metadata, fit, y_protein, dpc_fit, design, qc_stats, gsea_results, repro_log, covariate names, UI settings (contrast, logfc cutoff, q cutoff)
   - Load validates the session file has required fields before restoring
   - Restores UI state (contrast selector choices/selection, slider values)
   - Appends load event to reproducibility log with timestamp of original save
   - Uses `%||%` (null coalescing) for backwards compatibility with older session files
   - File naming: `DE-LIMP_session_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.rds`

### 2026-02-10: Added Reproducibility Log Download Feature
1. **Download Button for Reproducibility Log** (lines 460, 1085-1113)
   - Feature: Added download button in "Reproducibility > Code Log" tab
   - Downloads as timestamped .R file: `DE-LIMP_reproducibility_log_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.R`
   - Includes full analysis log + session info for complete reproducibility
   - Button styled with success class (green) and download icon for visibility

2. **Fixed CRAN Mirror Popup Issue** (line 7)
   - Problem: VS Code and non-interactive terminals couldn't display CRAN mirror selection popup
   - Solution: Set default CRAN mirror (`https://cloud.r-project.org`) before any package installations
   - Prevents "Please select a CRAN mirror" hanging during startup

3. **Fixed Missing Package Installation** (lines 92-95)
   - Problem: `readr`, `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `rhandsontable`, `arrow`, `shiny`, `bslib` not in auto-install list
   - Error: "there is no package called 'readr'" after installation completed
   - Solution: Added all library() packages to required_pkgs list for auto-installation
   - Ensures complete package installation before loading any libraries

4. **Fixed Invalid Icon Warning** (line 415)
   - Problem: "chart-scatter" is not a valid Font Awesome icon name
   - Warning: "The `name` provided ('chart-scatter') does not correspond to a known icon"
   - Solution: Changed to "chart-line" (valid Font Awesome icon)

5. **Enhanced Methodology Documentation** (lines 467, 1116-1200)
   - Feature: Comprehensive, well-formatted methodology text in "Reproducibility > Methodology" tab
   - Changed from `textOutput` to `verbatimTextOutput` for proper formatting with line breaks
   - Covers: Data input, DPC-CN normalization, maxLFQ quantification, limma statistical framework
   - Includes: Detailed explanation of empirical Bayes, FDR correction, and references
   - Provides proper citations for limpa, limma, and DIA-NN
   - Publication-ready text with clear section breaks and bullet points

6. **Added Fullscreen View for QC Trend Plot** (lines 404, 937-977)
   - Feature: "🔍 View Fullscreen" button in QC Trends tab
   - Opens plot in a large modal dialog (700px height, extra-large width)
   - Better for viewing on small monitors or detailed inspection
   - Modal has interactive controls (zoom, pan, export via plotly toolbar)
   - Click outside modal or "Close" button to dismiss

7. **Added Group Average Lines to QC Trend Plot** (lines 937-977)
   - Feature: Dashed horizontal lines showing average value for each group
   - Lines span the full range of each group on the x-axis
   - Color-matched to their respective groups for easy identification
   - Helps quickly identify group-level trends and compare averages
   - Works in both regular view and fullscreen modal

8. **Streamlined Workflow: Run Pipeline from Assign Groups Modal** (lines 359-362, 649-780)
   - Improvement: Removed standalone "Run Pipeline" button from sidebar
   - "Assign Groups" button now labeled "Assign Groups & Run Pipeline"
   - Modal footer has "▶ Run Pipeline" button instead of "Save & Close"
   - Workflow: Upload data → Open modal → Assign groups → Click "Run Pipeline" (all in one flow)
   - Validates groups (need 2+ groups) before running pipeline
   - Automatically closes modal and navigates to QC Plots tab when complete
   - More intuitive: users assign groups and immediately run analysis without extra steps

9. **Added Customizable Multiple Covariate Support** (lines 563-920)
   - Feature: Three covariate columns: Batch, Covariate1, Covariate2
   - **Customizable names**: Text inputs let you rename Covariate1/2 to anything (e.g., "Sex", "Diet", "Age")
   - Column headers update in real-time based on your custom names
   - Individual checkboxes: Select which covariates to include in the model
   - Design matrix: Dynamically builds formula using your custom names
   - Formula examples:
     - No covariates: `~ 0 + groups`
     - One covariate: `~ 0 + groups + batch`
     - Custom names: `~ 0 + groups + batch + sex + diet` (if you named them "Sex" and "Diet")
   - Validation: Only includes covariates with >1 unique non-empty values
   - Smart logging: Reproducibility log uses your custom covariate names
   - Use cases: Batch effects, Sex, Age, Diet, Instrument, Time_Point, etc.
   - Fully flexible: Name and use covariates for any categorical variable

10. **Improved Volcano Plot to Show Raw P-Values** (lines 1047-1051, 1302, 1634-1643)
   - Change: Volcano plot y-axis now uses non-adjusted P.Value instead of adj.P.Val
   - Rationale: Best practice in proteomics - visualize raw p-values, determine significance by FDR
   - **Significance coloring unchanged**: Red points still indicate FDR-corrected significance (adj.P.Val < 0.05)
   - Y-axis label: Explicitly labeled as "-log10(P-Value)" for clarity
   - **Results table**: Now shows both P.Value and adj.P.Val columns
   - **Grid view**: Also includes both P.Value and adj.P.Val for consistency
   - Horizontal line at -log10(0.05) represents unadjusted p-value threshold
   - Users can see both raw and adjusted p-values to understand statistical stringency

### 2026-02-10: Fixed Package Installation for First-Time Users
1. **Fixed Installation Conflicts** (lines 7-82)
   - Problem: Auto-installation tried to update already-loaded packages → ggplot2 unload errors
   - Solution: Check for missing packages BEFORE loading any libraries
   - Uses `update = FALSE` to prevent conflicts with loaded packages

2. **Fixed limpa Installation & R Version Check** (lines 16-62)
   - Problem: limpa requires R 4.5+, but error messages were unclear
   - Solution:
     - Check R version and provide clear upgrade instructions
     - Try Bioconductor release, then devel as fallback
     - Show exact version requirements (R 4.5+, Bioc 3.22+)
   - Key insight: limpa has been in Bioconductor since 3.21 (R 4.5 requirement)

3. **Improved Error Messages** (lines 46-58, 82-94)
   - Clear step-by-step instructions for upgrading R
   - Shows current vs required versions
   - Links to download page and Bioconductor docs

### 2026-02-09: Major Updates
1. **Fixed Startup Issue** (line 70)
   - Problem: dplyr `summarise()` syntax error in `get_diann_stats_r()`
   - Solution: Added explicit braces and `.groups = 'drop'`

2. **Enhanced Reproducibility Logging** (lines 399-426, 832-853)
   - Cumulative logging (appends instead of overwrites)
   - Timestamps for every action
   - Logs: data upload, pipeline runs, contrast changes, GSEA, exports
   - Helper function: `add_to_log(action_name, code_lines)`

3. **Fixed Violin Plot Button** (lines 943-954)
   - Problem: Button didn't recognize table row selections
   - Solution: Added observer to sync `input$de_table_rows_selected` → `values$plot_selected_proteins`

4. **Fixed Multi-Select in Results Table** (lines 763-807)
   - Problem: Reactive loop - table called `volcano_data()` which re-rendered on each selection
   - Solution: Made table build its own data independently, breaking the reactive loop
   - Result: Ctrl+Click and Shift+Click now work properly for multi-select

5. **Multi-Protein Violin Plots** (lines 956-1004)
   - Feature: Violin plot button now shows ALL selected proteins, not just first one
   - Layout: 2-column grid with facet_wrap
   - Dynamic height: Adjusts based on number of proteins (200px per row)
   - Individual scales: Each protein gets its own Y-axis (`scales = "free_y"`)

## Architecture Notes

### Key Reactive Values
- `values$plot_selected_proteins` - Selected proteins from table/volcano (used by all viz)
- `values$fit` - limma fit object from DE analysis
- `values$y_protein` - Protein-level quantification matrix
- `values$repro_log` - Cumulative R code for reproducibility

### LIMPA Pipeline Flow
1. `readDIANN()` - Load DIA-NN parquet file
2. `dpcCN()` - Data Point Correspondence normalization
3. `dpcQuant()` - Peptide → protein quantification
4. `dpcDE()` - Differential expression model
5. `contrasts.fit()` + `eBayes()` - Pairwise comparisons

### Selection System
- Volcano plot click/box-select → updates `values$plot_selected_proteins`
- Table row selection → updates `values$plot_selected_proteins`
- Both sync bidirectionally for highlighting

## Development Workflow

### Running the App
**In VS Code R Terminal (recommended):**
```r
shiny::runApp('/Users/brettphinney/Documents/claude/DE-LIMP.r', port=3838, launch.browser=TRUE)
```

**From command line (background mode):**
```bash
Rscript -e "shiny::runApp('/Users/brettphinney/Documents/claude/DE-LIMP.r', port=3838)" &
```

**Important Notes:**
- **DO NOT use** `source()` to launch the app - it doesn't work properly in VS Code
- **Always use** `shiny::runApp()` instead
- Shiny apps don't hot-reload - must restart after every code change
- Stop the app with `Ctrl+C` in the terminal, or `pkill -f "DE-LIMP.r"` from command line

### Useful Commands
- **Check if app is running**: `lsof -i :3838`
- **Stop the app**: `pkill -f "DE-LIMP.r"`
- **Restart after changes**: Stop the app, then run the `shiny::runApp()` command again

## Key Patterns & Gotchas

### Package Installation & Loading
- **CRITICAL**: Check and install packages BEFORE any `library()` calls
- Attempting to install/update packages after they're loaded causes unload errors
- Pattern from this project (lines 16-81):
  ```r
  # 1. Check R/Bioc versions
  # 2. Install missing packages
  # 3. THEN load libraries with library() calls
  ```
- Use `update = FALSE` in `BiocManager::install()` to prevent updating already-loaded packages
- Use `upgrade = "never"` in `remotes::install_*()` for same reason

### R Shiny Reactivity
- **DT table row indices** refer to CURRENTLY DISPLAYED data (filtered or not)
- **Avoid circular reactivity**: Don't filter data based on a reactive value that the filter updates
- **CRITICAL Reactive Loop Pattern**:
  - If `renderDT` depends on a reactive that uses `values$selection`
  - AND selecting rows updates `values$selection`
  - → Creates infinite loop: selection → reactive update → table re-render → selection reset
  - **Solution**: Make `renderDT` build data independently without reactive dependencies on selection state
- Use `isolate()` to break reactive dependencies when needed
- DT tables with `selection = "multiple"` support Ctrl+Click and Shift+Click

### dplyr/tidyverse Best Practices
- In `summarise()`, use explicit `{}` braces for multi-line if statements
- Always set `.groups = 'drop'` to avoid grouping warnings
- Can't use bracket subsetting `[condition]` directly on column names inside summarise - need proper context
- Example from this project (line 70):
```r
summarise(
  Proteins = if(has_pg_q) {
    n_distinct(Protein.Group[PG.Q.Value <= 0.01])
  } else {
    n_distinct(Protein.Group)
  },
  .groups = 'drop'
)
```

### Reproducibility Logging Pattern
- Log actions with timestamps, not just final code
- Use cumulative logging (append) rather than overwrite
- Include context: which button was clicked, which parameters changed
- Add human-readable action names before code blocks
- Implementation: `add_to_log(action_name, code_lines)` helper function

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Installation Issues
1. **"Please select a CRAN mirror" popup not showing (VS Code)**:
   - Root cause: VS Code's R terminal doesn't display interactive popups
   - Fixed in current version: CRAN mirror set automatically (line 7)
   - Manual fix: Add `options(repos = c(CRAN = "https://cloud.r-project.org"))` at top of script

1a. **"there is no package called 'readr'" (or other package) after installation**:
   - Root cause: Package not included in auto-installation list (required_pkgs)
   - Fixed in current version: All library() packages now auto-installed (lines 92-95)
   - Manual fix: Add missing package to required_pkgs vector

2. **"limpa package not found" or "R 4.5 required"**:
   - Root cause: limpa requires R 4.5+ (in Bioconductor 3.22+)
   - Solution: Upgrade R from https://cloud.r-project.org/
   - Then run: `BiocManager::install('limpa')`
   - The app will auto-detect version mismatch and show instructions

3. **"Package ggplot2 cannot be unloaded" during installation**:
   - Root cause: Installation happening after packages already loaded
   - Fixed in current version: packages checked/installed BEFORE library() calls (lines 16-81)
   - Workaround: Restart R session completely before running app

4. **"limpa is not available for Bioconductor version X.XX"**:
   - limpa requires Bioc 3.22+ (which requires R 4.5+)
   - Check your version: `BiocManager::version()`
   - Upgrade R to 4.5+ first, then Bioconductor will auto-update

### Runtime Issues
5. **App doesn't start when using `source()` in VS Code**:
   - Problem: Using `source("/path/to/DE-LIMP.r")` doesn't launch the app properly
   - Solution: Use `shiny::runApp('/Users/brettphinney/Documents/claude/DE-LIMP.r', port=3838, launch.browser=TRUE)`
   - This is the correct way to launch Shiny apps in VS Code

6. **App won't start after code changes**:
   - Shiny apps don't hot-reload
   - Must stop (`Ctrl+C`) and rerun the `shiny::runApp()` command

7. **Violin plot shows "select protein first"**:
   - Make sure table/volcano selection observer is working (line ~1115)

8. **Can't select multiple proteins**:
   - Ensure table is NOT filtered by selections
   - Check for reactive loops - table should NOT call `volcano_data()` directly

9. **Selections disappear after clicking**:
   - Reactive loop! Table re-renders on selection changes
   - Solution: Make table build data independently without reactive dependencies on selection state

### Git/Version Control Issues
10. **GitHub shows old/wrong version despite local file being correct**:
   - Problem: Local file (1715 lines) correct, but GitHub shows old version (459 lines)
   - Root cause: Modified file was NOT staged/committed to git (`git status` shows "Changes not staged")
   - Symptoms: `git diff HEAD origin/main` shows no difference, but GitHub is wrong
   - How to check: `git show HEAD:DE-LIMP.R | wc -l` to see what's actually in the git commit
   - Solution: `git add DE-LIMP.R && git commit -m "message" && git push origin main`
   - **Key lesson**: Always check `git status` and commit working files before assuming they're in the repo
   - Fixed in commit b2fbf11 (2026-02-10)

## AI Chat Feature
- Uses Google Gemini API
- Uploads top 800 proteins via File API
- Bi-directional: User selects proteins → AI analyzes, AI finds proteins → highlights in plots
- Selection format: `[[SELECT: P12345; P67890]]`
